*ABOUT*

Statistical aid for analyzing litter sizes in transgenic animal models in research.  

A colony ID number can be entered that belongs to the colony of an animal model, and information will be displayed that belongs to the colony's litters.  A database will be queried for all information.  Litter sizes at 5-7 days old and at weaning (21-25 days old) will be displayed in breedings producing each respective experimental and control cohorts. The information given will help the colony manager decide on the appropriate number of females needed for breeding to achieve a desired number of animals for a cohort.  Comparison of litter size between the two age groups and between the experimental and control cohorts will also point to any high mortality rate or reduction in fecundity in any cohort.

*DETAILED USAGE*

1.  Information regarding colonies will first have to be entered in database.  The schema used for the database is comprised of three tables: colony, breedings, litters.  An image describing the columns in each of those three tables is attached to this repository.  
2.  Enter colony ID number and hit "Submit"
